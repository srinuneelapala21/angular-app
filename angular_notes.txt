Angular is a Java Script framework for building single page applications
->Angular 1 also called AngularJS  developed by Googles and it uses Java Script
->Angular 2 onwards it is completly different from angularjs and it uses typescripts

->node modules --> no need to commit to repo
->package.json -> it will have the necessary dependencies
->angular.json -> all the application related configuration

->application bootstrap flow --> index.html -> main.ts -> app.module.
->AppModule -> it is the root module of every angular application
->app.module: every component you created must be declare here

*TypeScript
->TypeScript is the Super Set of JavaScript..So any valid Javascript code is also compiled by typescript compiler
->ts is strongly typed where as js is dynamically typed
-> ts has some oops features like interfaces,generics 
-> in ts we can catch errors at compile time instead of run time

*Adding bootstrap
1.install bootstrap
-- npm i --save bootstrap
2.Add path to angular.json in styles array

Data binding-- {{}}

property Binding -- [disabled]="allowUser" or [formGroup]="formGroup"

event Binding -- (click)

$event -- using this we can send data from an eventBinding  -- (input)="onUpdate($event)"

for *ngIf else condition we need to create a <ng-template #id>content<ng-template>

*ngFor="let x of array"

debugging angular -- augury


sending data from parent component to child -- @Input('alias name')
sending data from child to parent  -- @Output() = new EventEmitter<>()
