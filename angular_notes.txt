Angular is a Java Script framework for building single page applications
->Angular 1 also called AngularJS  developed by Googles and it uses Java Script
->Angular 2 onwards it is completly different from angularjs and it uses typescripts

node modules --> no need to commit to repo
package.json -> it will have the necessary dependencies
angular.json -> all the application related configuration

flow -->
index.html -> main.ts -> app.module

app.module: every component you created must be declare here


Data binding-- {{}}

property Binding -- [disabled]="allowUser" or [formGroup]="formGroup"

event Binding -- (click)

$event -- using this we can send data from an eventBinding  -- (input)="onUpdate($event)"

for *ngIf else condition we need to create a <ng-template #id>content<ng-template>

*ngFor="let x of array"

debugging angular -- augury


sending data from parent component to child -- @Input('alias name')
sending data from child to parent  -- @Output() = new EventEmitter<>()
